+ Project summary: In this project, we created a classification engine for facial emotion recognition. We tested various models including: baseline Baseline Model (GBT), XGBoost, Random Forest, SVM, NN, CNN, VGG16（Transfer Learning), logistic (starter code), PCA+LDA and KNN. 

We decided that NN preforms best, even though we expected CNN to be the most appropriate model. Finally, we were able to improve the baseline model’s performance in all parameters (accuracy, AUC).
